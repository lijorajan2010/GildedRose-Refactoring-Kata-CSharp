Used Factory Adapter and Strategy patterns

I have separated the logic with different strategies in the 
GildedRose-CSharp.Domain project
The Factory pattern defines the strategies / strategy classes object 
when we call it from the Program.cs main method.

Added Test project and methods for the logics defined in the strategy classes
